// in this folder, we'd normally have stores and slices (using Redux toolkit, maybe Reselect as well)
// for each of the models available

// so in a transportation company, for example, if in the backend we'd have 4 models, User, Company, Routes, Bookings
// then we'd have (for each of the model) stores and slices with their respective selectors, in order to manage state, given the app is complex enough
